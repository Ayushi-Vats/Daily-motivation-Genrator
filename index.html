        <h1>Daily motivation</h1>
        <p class="intro">Each day brings a new beginning — a fresh page in the book of your life. 
           <br> No matter what yesterday looked like, today is full of endless possibilities. 
            <br>You are stronger than you think, more capable than you know, and the universe is always on your side. 
            <br>Take a deep breath, smile, and step forward with love and light in your heart. You’ve got this.</p>
